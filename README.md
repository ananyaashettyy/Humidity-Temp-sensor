Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using ESP8266

This project demonstrates a simple IoT-based temperature and humidity monitoring system without cloud integration. It uses the ESP8266 NodeMCU and DHT11 sensor to measure environmental data and display it directly on a web interface hosted locally by the ESP8266 module.

Features:

Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring

Wi-Fi connectivity for local web-based data access

Simple and cost-effective hardware setup

Hardware: ESP8266, DHT11, Breadboard, Jumper Wires

Software: Arduino IDE, DHT & ESP8266WiFi Libraries
